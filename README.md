# Hauptwerk Hardware

A collection of Arduino sketches for my console build

Currently this is:

| Folder | Purpose |
|------- | ------ |
| midi-mega-keyboard | Arduino Mega 2560: 61 note keyboard, 1 key per contact, MIDI over Serial |
| midi-pipe-serial | Connect serial MIDI to a USB capable board, e.g. Pro Micro, to allow Arduino to Arduino serial comms then the Pro Micro is a USB MIDI interface |
